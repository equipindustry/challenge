Challenge
=========

Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is our challenge for potential new developer team members.

Notes
-----

-  This should be fun! If you're stuck on a bug or something needs
   clarification you can `email to Equip <mailto:tiago@equipindustry.com?subject=Challenge>`__ for help.
-  If you prefer a functional style (or some other style of programming)
   feel free to switch things up to suit how you write best. We left the
   codebase intentionally small to support different styles/complete
   rewrites. Don't let how we've set things up get in the way of showing
   us your best work.

Your Quest
----------

-  [ ] Write some unit tests for your server side code

Done?
-----

Great job! When you're all finished, open a PR and we'll review it ðŸ™Œ
