Frontend Challenge - EquipIndustry
==================================

This is a placement test. We would like to clarify that we don't expect
everyone to fullfill it in its whole since it is meant for every career

Javascript. The goal is to assess your experience in writing **code that
is easy to maintain, loosely coupled and highly cohesive**.
